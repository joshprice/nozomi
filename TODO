TODO list

[ ] build up gemfile piece by piece based on choices
[ ] choose persistence (postgresql, mysql, mongodb or just stick with rails)
[ ] choose deployment (or just go with capistrano by default)

# ideas:
#   test to see if you have the correct rails version
#   make each opinion one change to the gemfile so each commit contains one opinion
#   .nozomi file or folder created on each nozomi run
#   -i interactive mode
