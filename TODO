TODO list

[ ] Creating a new project takes way too long
  [ ] bundler keeps running, is this really necessary? Can we "bundle exec" everything instead?
  [ ] Too many warnings
    [ ] bundle exec guard
  [x] Log is really hard to read
  [ ] Where is the success message at the end?
  
[ ] Errors in tasks should be more obvious
[ ] ordering of templates is important
[ ] separation of template components and composed templates (eg core/standard) also dependencies (eg core depends on git)


# ideas:
#   test to see if you have the correct rails version
#   make each opinion one change to the gemfile so each commit contains one opinion
#   .nozomi file or folder created on each nozomi run
#   -i interactive mode
